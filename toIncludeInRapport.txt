The benchmarks should contain not just show, but write, and consider comparing writing to something that doesn't exist and overwriting (so deleting the original file) and then writing

Writing is better than count because count might not actually apply all the transformations and might just count the size of the file
Collect is maybe too heavy for most computers because the files are 4gb and to load all that in memory might cause an out of memeory exception,
to avoid this we should increase the memory of the driver so that it can hold all the data

Writing will always take longer than collecting because writing literally has to copy the information somewhere
